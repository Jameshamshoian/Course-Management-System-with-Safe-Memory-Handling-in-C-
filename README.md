# Course-Management-System-with-Safe-Memory-Handling-in-C-
Dynamic course management system supporting section edits, grade tracking, and averages with rule-of-three memory safety.
This project implements a course and section management system in C++ using dynamic data structures. It supports section insertion/removal, grade tracking in 2D arrays, and average calculations at multiple levels. The system applies the rule of three (destructor, copy constructor, assignment operator) to ensure safe memory handling, with correctness verified through unit tests and Valgrind.
